Hangman Game
Description:
This is a simple text-based Hangman game. The game selects a random word, and the player tries to guess it one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game is lost. The goal is to guess the entire word before running out of chances!

Features:
A random word is selected from a predefined list.
The player can guess one letter at a time.
The number of incorrect guesses is limited (can be customized).
The game displays the current progress of the word, showing correctly guessed letters and placeholders (_) for remaining letters.
The game ends when the player either guesses the word or exceeds the allowed number of incorrect guesses.

How to Play:
Run the program.
The game will display the word in the form of underscores (_) representing unguessed letters.
Enter a letter to make a guess.
If the guess is correct, the letter will be revealed in the word.
If the guess is incorrect, the number of remaining chances decreases.
Continue guessing until you either guess the entire word or run out of chances.
Game Rules
The player is allowed a certain number of incorrect guesses (commonly 6-8).
Correct guesses reveal all instances of the guessed letter in the word.
The game ends with a win if the player guesses all the letters of the word.
The game ends with a loss if the player runs out of guesses before completing the word.
